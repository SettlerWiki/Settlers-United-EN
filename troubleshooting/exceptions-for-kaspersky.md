# Exceptions for Kaspersky

In the Kaspersky menu you need to click on the cogwheel -> click on "Threats and Exceptions", then scroll down to Exceptions.

For "Customize Exceptions" add the following:

* C:\Users\Public\Desktop\Settlers United.Ink&#x20;
* Settlers-United.exe (in whatever directory you have the exe file in)&#x20;
* C:\Users\Appdata\Roaming\Settlers United
* the entire Ubisoft folder, to be on the safe side

&#x20;It is best to tick all the boxes for the respective options.\


Then list the following under "Customize exceptions" under "Trusted programs":

* C:\Users\Public\Desktop\Settlers United.Ink
* Settlers-United.exe (in whatever directory you have the exe file in)&#x20;
* C:\Program Files\Settlers United\Settlers United.exe&#x20;



Maybe less will do (especially if you don't have a desktop shortcut or the Ubi folder)
