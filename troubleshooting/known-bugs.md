# Known Bugs

## **HD patch is not up to date / warning message of the ModApi appears when starting Settlers IV.**&#x20;

**Cause:** Error during patching, error in previous download, too little hard disk space, virus scanner or other computer problems. \
**Suggested solution**: The folders: ".settlers-united" and "Plugins" should be deleted in the main directory of Settlers IV. Then restart the computer, set any virus scanners and download the HD patch again by starting a new game. The installation can take more than 10 minutes in exceptional cases.
